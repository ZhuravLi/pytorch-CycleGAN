# pytorch-CycleGAN

This is my implementation of CycleGAN using PyTorch, the final project for DLS MIPT course. 
[About CycleGANs](https://hardikbansal.github.io/CycleGANBlog/),
[Link to the original article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593). 

In this  realization of CycleGAN, there few tricks were applied:
* One-sided label smoothing.
We use targets for real imgs in the discriminator with a value of 0.9.
* We took ReLU as the activation function for generators and LeakyReLU for discriminators.
* During training, a batch size of 1 were used.
* Replay buffer was used to train discriminators. Generated images are added to the replay buffer and sampled from it.

## Visuals
CycleGAN was trained on [monet2photo dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/monet2photo) with 100 epochs and lr=2e-4.
Here some results:

## Installation
Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZhuravLi/pytorch-CycleGAN
cd pytorch-CycleGAN
```
Then install requirements
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing

Setup the dataset. Download it from UC Berkeley's repository:
```bash
./scripts/download_dataset.sh monet2photo
```
Datasets directory looks like this:

    .
    ├── datasets                   
    |   ├── <dataset_name>         # monet2photo
    |   |   ├── trainA             
    |   |   ├── trainB    
    |   |   ├── testA        
    |   |   └── testB          

Download weights of dataset:
```bash
./scripts/download_model.sh monet2photo
```
Checkpoint directory has the following structure:

    .
    ├── checkpoints                   
    |   ├── <dataset_name>_pretrained         # monet2photo_pretrained
    |   |   ├── gen_A2B.pt                    
    |   |   └── gen_B2A.pt  

Finally, testing:

```python
 python -m test --num_test 50
```
Flag `--num_test 50` is responsible for the number of images generated in one direction. You may use `--cuda` for using GPU. You may change paths to generator's weights, if you want to. Use `python -m test --help` to see more details.
Result images are saved at `./output/testing`. After each test, this directory will be cleaned.

## Training

Setup the dataset. Download it from UC Berkeley's repository:
```bash
./scripts/download_dataset.sh monet2photo
```
Datasets directory looks like this:

    .
    ├── datasets                   
    |   ├── <dataset_name>         # monet2photo
    |   |   ├── trainA             
    |   |   ├── trainB    
    |   |   ├── testA        
    |   |   └── testB          


Finally, training:

```python
 python -m train --start_epoch 0 --num_epochs 10 --cuda --n_cpu 2
```
You may use `--cuda` for using GPU. Use `python -m train --help` to see more details.
When model has done its work, your weights are saved at `checkpoints` directory, that looks like this:

    .
    ├── checkpoints                   
    |   ├── <dataset_name>_training         # monet2photo_training
    |   |   ├── disc_A     
    |   |   |   ├── disc_A_0001.pt
    |   |   |   :
    |   |   |   └── disc_A_0010.pt
    |   |   ├── disc_B   
    |   |   |   ├── disc_B_0001.pt
    |   |   |   :
    |   |   |   └── disc_B_0010.pt
    |   |   ├── gen_A2B     
    |   |   |   ├── gen_A2B_0001.pt
    |   |   |   :
    |   |   |   └── gen_A2B_0010.pt          
    |   |   ├── gen_B2A
    |   |   |   ├── gen_B2A_0001.pt
    |   |   |   :
    |   |   |   └── gen_B2A_0010.pt  
    |   |   └── losses
    |   |   |   ├── losses_0001.pt
    |   |   |   :
    |   |   |   └── losses_0010.pt 

All weights after each epoch are saved. After that, you may continue your training using previous weights.

```python
 python -m train --start_epoch 10 --num_epochs 2 --cuda --n_cpu 2
```
Result images are saved at `./output/training` after each epoch.
